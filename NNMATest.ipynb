      "I am going to use an accessible example to try to explain my PhD research on x-ray spectromicroscopy imaging and classifying absorption spectra using non-negative matrix approximation (NNMA).  (Don't worry if it doesn't resonate with you immediately &mdash; keep reading!  The purpose of this page is to show a tangible example!)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll start with some introduction about what NNMA does, relate it experimental x-ray samples, introduce an accessible analogy, show some Python code that performs the NNMA itself, present the results, and finally add some concluding comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-negative matrix approximation (NNMA, or also NMF, for non-negative matrix factorization) has been used as a learning algorithm in facial recognition.  The idea is to \"factorize\" a database of faces into their component features (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, etc.), with each feature having some weighting.  This process simplifies a jumble of faces into a simpler set (of component features).  Then, given a new face, could we figure out whether this face belongs to the database (perhaps posed under different lighting conditions, or tilted at a different angle), or is it an entirely new face?  If we could add up the features we've just learned in some weighted combination to match this face, then we have successfully recognized the new face as one already belonging to the database.  If not, then it is likely not a face in the original database.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, instead of a database of faces, we have a stack of 2D x-ray absorption images of some sample (say, a biological cell).  Each of the images in the stack is of the same sample, only differing in x-ray absorption energy.  If you choose a fixed pixel on the image, and traverse down the stack, you can see how the absorption of that pixel changes as a function of energy &mdash; this is the absorption spectrum at that pixel.  As an analogy to the face database described above: each spectrum is like a series of faces of the same person under different conditions, and each pixel is like the face of a different person.  So we have a set of many, many spectra (as many spectra as there are pixels in the image, could be >10<sup>6</sup>), and we would like to decompose them into a smaller, simpler set which could still be added up in some weighted combination to reconstruct the spectrum of any pixel.  In a nutshell: we can use NNMA to unmix or reduce the large set of mixed spectra into the simplest set possible which would still contain the information needed to reconstruct any of the original spectra.  This simpler set provides a clearer picture for understanding the chemical components that make up the sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, enough with the words &mdash; onto the promised tangible example!  (Note: as with any simplified analogy, the correspondence is not exact and some details are not accounted for; but simplifications often offer insights that can help clarify a more complex problem.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you have an RGB colour image (of anything colourful; say, peppers): <br><img src=\"figures/peppers.jpg\" width=\"50%\">\n",
      "\n",
      "Each pixel contains some colour, but even two red pixels may not be the exact same shade of red.  So here we have 503&times;302 pixels &mdash; potentially 151,906 different shades of different colours.  Can we reduce this set into a smaller set that could still be used to reconstruct the colour of any given pixel?  For an RGB image, the answer is already given: yes!  Each pixel is an (R, G, B) tuple (where each of the R, G, and B can take on any value from 0 to 255 inclusive) and so can be decomposed into its R (red), G (green), and B (blue) components!  The values in the tuples are just the weightings of the respective components in the pixel.<br>\n",
      "E.g., (255, 128, 0) represents fully saturated red + half-saturated green + no blue = an orangey colour.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So instead of describing the image using 151,906 different colours, each pixel is now specified instead as some weighted combination of 3 colours.  Thus we have reduced it a big, chaotic set of colours to a simpler set of just 3!  \n",
      "\n",
      "The above may sound obvious (or maybe not), but let's relate this back to our x-ray spectromicroscopy application: at each pixel in the image, the absorption spectrum is a result of the absorption characteristics of a mixture of materials.  We don't necessarily know what the materials are, nor their ratios.  Since the amount of each material may differ in each pixel, we have as many different absorption spectra as there are number of pixels (as mentioned above, possibly >10<sup>6</sup>).  We would like to reduce this vast set of spectra to a smaller set, which can be used (in some weighted combination) to describe the absorption of any pixel.  This smaller set, like the {R, G, B} set of colours, can shed light on the understanding of the material composition of a sample.  (Small note: instead of a set like {R, G, B}, in this case we're looking for a set of spectra; each spectrum is an array of numbers that is a function of energy, not a scalar value like R, or G, or B.  But this is just some detail that's not too important for the purpose of this illustration.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's run an NNMA test on an RGB image to decompose it into its components and respective weightings, then use them to reconstruct the image and compare it with the original."

For example, in the component 3 thickness map, the red peppers show up as the brightest &mdash; so the component 3 represents R in this case (despite the fact that it's drawn in blue).

      "We've interpreted the 3 components that we extracted using NNMA as the 3 basic RGB colours that make up each pixel.  This is cheating a bit, since we <em>knew beforehand</em> that the format of the image is RGB and that each pixel is composed of an RGB tuple, and so we knew to decompose the image into 3 components.\n",
      "\n",
      "In x-ray spectromicroscopy, we <em>don't</em> know beforehand how many components to look for, since we don't usually know what the sample is composed of exactly.  We may have some prior knowledge about the sample &mdash; say, it contains different compounds of copper &mdash; but we don't know exactly which ones, nor how many different kinds, so there is some guesswork involved (fortunately, not pure guesswork as there are other methods we could run on the data before NNMA, such as principal component analysis and cluster analysis, to get an idea beforehand about the number and variation of components in the sample).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is like trying to run NNMA on an RGB image not knowing what objects are in it, and seeing if we could find components that represent peppers, garlic, the backdrop, etc.  But the image itself does not contain this information (a pixel representing a purple background would contain exactly the same RGB tuple as a pixel representing a pepper with the same purple colour, for example) &mdash; so we cannot run NNMA on an RGB image and expect to discover this type of information  (though there are other image classification techniques that could be used for this).  X-ray absorption spectra, however, do contain information about the chemical content of the material at each pixel &mdash; and that's why it's interesting to apply NNMA to x-ray spectromicroscopy images to study the composition of materials!\n"
